# Sentiment Analysis of Yelp reviews using PyTorch Lightning and Torchtext

This project demonstrates the implementation of a binary sentiment analysis model using PyTorch Lightning. The model classifies Yelp restaurant reviews as positive or negative. Detailed instructions on data processing, model training, and evaluation can be found in the Jupyter notebook (`Sentiment_analysis_reviews.ipynb`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 was used in this project
- A virtual environment is recommended for managing dependencies.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

- On Windows:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **Running the Project**
5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the Sentiment_analysis_reviews.ipynb notebook and run through the steps.
